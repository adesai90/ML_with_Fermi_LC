#  ML with Fermi Light Curves:
This project makes use of Astrophysical Light curve data (with is time series observations of a particular source) in a ML project. The data is collected over a long period (~15 years) and fed to a ML algorithm to make predicitions in time. While the repository here describes the first steps of the work done, the results of the project will be made available in form of a publication soon.

For more details or if you would like to use the code and look at the data used, please contact Abhishek Desai at [adesai.physics@gmail.com].


Additional Details: 
- Codes: Main directory containing all the codes (To be updated after publication).
- For the purpose of debugging and undestanding, all portions of the code is kept in one ipython notebook. 
- An example result using a 3day training is shown in sample_output.pdf where the dotted red line is the prediction based on training data. While it is extremely difficult to predict the exact behavior of the sources used (as there are no specific periodic emissions), this prediction already shows that there might be some periodicity in the observed data (allowing for more detailed scientific interpretition).
- Note that this is an initial version of the project and the complete work will be made public in the future.
- These will be streamlined in a future version to be used for publication.
- The relevant data used in the code will also be made availabe ina future versiaon.
